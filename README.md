##Setup instructions to get the dashboard up and running.
1. cd into frontend and run npm install, repeat the process for backend.
2. Run the command "nodemon index.js" for the backend.
3. Run the command "npm run dev" for running frontend.


##A brief overview of key features and how to use them.
1. Login/Signup.
2. You will access the Dashboard, where there will be a few posts.
3. You can create a post, which will immediately create a post.
4. You can Schedule a post, which will schedule the post to be posted at the given time.

##Any assumptions you made during development.
1. I assume the dashboard will be similar to the timeline of any social media application.
2. I did not focus heavily on styling.

##Challenges you encountered and how you addressed them.
1. Doing Schedule posting - I had to google about it a little, then I got to know about this library called node-schedule, which helped in making Schedule posts.
